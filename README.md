# BIDS Open Access Policy

BIDS should provide limited funds for open access publishing for its junior fellows
and staff for BIDS-related publications.

Grant funded research should be published using grant money.

## Eligibility

- Any BIDS post-doc, academic staff, or currently enrolled graduate student who has had
  an open access article, chapter, or scholarly book accepted for publication,
  and does not have other sources of funds to pay author processing charges.
- Article, chapter, or scholarly book must pertain to BIDS mission.

## Restrictions 

- One application per individual per calendar year.
- Fees will be subsidized only for fully open access journals or books (that
  is, the entire journal or book must be freely available to the public without
  a subscription or access fee).
- BIDS will fund up to $2,500 in fees.
